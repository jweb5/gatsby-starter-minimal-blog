## Testimonials

Testimonials are one of the most influential and powerful social proof tools used in marketing today. At their core, testimonials are an endorsement of a product or service a customer has consumed. 

Testimonials can take many different forms, and you may be surprised to see testimonials all around you once you open your eyes for them. 

Just to paint the picture of how testimonials are everywhere, imagine a few scenarios:

Think about every review site you have ever visited (i.e. Yelp, Google) before going to a restaurant, store or service.

Now think about every product review you have read before making a purchase. Did you ever check the star rating on a product before putting it in your cart?

Next think about the requirement of references on your resume when applying for a job. Or the endorsements section of linked in. 

Testimonials can take many forms in addition the the examples above, but we'll save that for another time. 

## What are testimonials used for?

Testimonials are used to build trust with a customer or consumer of the product you may be offering. Building trust helps increase sales. 

They help potential buyers or consumers feel at ease with making a purchase with you or using your product. When someone sees that another person has had a good experience with you, and has gone to the extent of giving positive feedback, then that makes them more comfortable with taking a risk with you as well. 

They help readers of your content feel that you are valid enough to be a legitimate source of information. Think about the back covers of non-fiction books - they are often covered with testimonials. 

## Examples of testimonials

E-commerce retailer Warby Parker has a whole page dedicated to customer reviews (testimonials) on their website.

## How to get customer testimonials

While there are many different ways someone could go about getting a testimonial, but the only two honest ways to get one are to a) ask a customer for the testimonial, or b) receive the testimonial without asking. Both are fair ways of getting them, but making up a testimonial is not one of those options. A testimonial should be legitimate from a customer. 

You can take testimonials that already exist from customers via your product reviews, or possibly reviews of your company on public review sites (Google, Yelp, etc).

To ask for a testimonial, you can contact previous customers via any communication channel, whether that is social or private. You can use the following script, or something similar to it, to get the testimonial:

"Hi Joe, You recently purchased a product from my store. I was wondering if you could help me "
